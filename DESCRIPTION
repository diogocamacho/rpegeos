Description: An algorithm to perform gene set enrichment based on natural language processing approaches. Similar to over-representation analyses, this approach treats each gene set as a bag of words, where the genes are the words for that gene set. The term-frequency and inverse document frequency is calculated and the signficance of the enrichment is done by computing the cosine similarity between the query gene set and gene sets of interest.
